                                VirtusHost is a host service provider which is pioneer when we talk about datacenter in Brazil. Their services are focused on game services such as VPS and Dedicated Servers to games like Minecraft, Rust and Ragnarok. The company also works with Virtual Datacenters and Web Hosting using Apache + Nginx. In this company I used to work with technologies such as PHP on Back-end and HTML, CSS (plus Bootstrap), JavaScript (plus jQuery, AJAX and JSON) to create new features and fix UI/UX issues on Front-end. We also used Git to code versioning.

I was designed to develop new websites and integrate it with Zaite Pronto using technologies such as PHP on Back-end and also HTML, CSS, JavaScript (plus jQuery, AJAX and RESTful) on Front-end and using MySQL as DB.

                                KSRP was a <b>GTAV Roleplay game server</b>. Using <a href="https://fivem.net/" target="_blank">FiveM</a> as game's modification platform and Lua programming language we made a simulation of real world using the graphic engine of GTA V (game). KSRP has become the biggest <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gtav+roleplay" target="_blank">roleplay server</a> in Brazil for a long time with more than active 1.000 players per week. In this project I dedicated my time and experience to challenge myself learning Lua such as Node.js and TypeScript, also increasing my knowledge and skills in Front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and jQuery mostly) which I used to create new interfaces. Today, KSRP became <a href="https://discord.gg/ZVFU7czbKC" target="_blank"><b>KS Community</b></a> server on Discord to help people to start programming in Lua and providing knowledge to everyone. The main topic of the community is Lua/FiveM. You can find more about our project searching on <a href="https://youtu.be/_snSbWWmJwI?t=246" target="_blank">YouTube</a> <i>(portuguese only)</i>.

                                This project was a personal project and the initial idea was create a fully customizable forum focused on <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/pt-pt/" target="_blank">Minecraft</a> Servers for Minecraft gamers inspired by <a href="https://xenforo.com/" target="_blank">XenForo</a>. We deployed the website using Ubuntu Server 16.04 + LEMP Server and GitHub to code versioning and production deploy. At first, the project was developed using PHP, JavaScript + jQuery, HTML5, MySQL, CSS3 + Semantic UI, Ajax (polling), JSON, RESTful APIs and a real-time public chat. The project was very welcomed by the community because of possibility to integrate <b>Minecraft Plugins</b> (built in Java) with the system, feeding the forum and pages with game's information, custom login with plugins and also Facebook Login Integration on account after registration directly in game, <b><a href="https://github.com/mercadopago/dx-php" target="_blank">MercadoPago</a></b> and <b><a href="https://github.com/pagseguro/pagseguro-sdk-php" target="_blank">PagSeguro</a></b> SDK Integration, and we also MySQL/SQLite as Database Driver.
